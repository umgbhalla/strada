# otel-collector

Cloudflare Worker (Spiceflow) that receives OTLP HTTP/JSON from OTel SDKs and forwards to Tinybird Events API as NDJSON.

## JSON only

This collector only accepts **OTLP HTTP/JSON** (`Content-Type: application/json`). It does NOT support protobuf or gRPC. The worker parses incoming requests with `request.json()` and the types in `otlp-types.ts` match the JSON wire format of the OTLP spec.

Users must configure their OTel SDKs to export as JSON, not protobuf. For the JS SDK this means using the `-http` exporter packages (`@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`) or setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json`.

## Endpoints

- `POST /v1/traces` → transforms to NDJSON → writes to `otel_traces`
- `POST /v1/logs` → transforms to NDJSON → writes to `otel_logs`
- `POST /v1/metrics` → transforms to NDJSON → writes to `otel_metrics_gauge`, `otel_metrics_sum`, `otel_metrics_histogram`, `otel_metrics_exponential_histogram` (depending on metric type)

## Multi-tenancy

Tenant ID is extracted from the request hostname. See the root `AGENTS.md` for the full explanation. The function is in `get-tenant-id.ts`.

## Auth

`auth.ts` validates the `x-api-key` header. Two key types:
- `sk_*` (server key) — no origin check
- `pk_*` (browser key) — origin checked against allowlist

## Transform pipeline

Each signal has a transform module that converts OTLP JSON into Tinybird NDJSON:
- `transform-traces.ts` — flattens `resourceSpans[].scopeSpans[].spans[]` into rows
- `transform-logs.ts` — flattens `resourceLogs[].scopeLogs[].logRecords[]` into rows
- `transform-metrics.ts` — flattens `resourceMetrics[].scopeMetrics[].metrics[]` into rows, splitting by metric type (gauge/sum/histogram/exponential histogram)
- `transform-attributes.ts` — shared utilities (attribute conversion, nanosecond timestamps, exemplars)

All transforms inject `tenant_id` into every row.

## Error extraction

`extract-errors.ts` scans incoming logs and traces for exceptions:
- From logs: log records with `exception.type` or `exception.message` in `LogAttributes`
- From traces: span events named `exception`

Extracted errors are written to `otel_errors` with fingerprinting for issue grouping. See root `AGENTS.md` for the full error tracking documentation.

## Testing

Run tests with `vitest run` (not `vitest` which starts watch mode and never exits):

```bash
pnpm vitest run                           # all tests
pnpm vitest run src/extract-errors.test.ts # single file
```
