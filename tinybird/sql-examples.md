title: SQL query examples
description: Example queries to run against the OTel tables via Tinybird Query API (/v0/sql). These replace the pipe endpoints from the upstream tinybird-otel-template — we query directly with SQL instead.
---

All queries below are meant to be sent as raw SQL to Tinybird's Query API:

```
POST https://api.tinybird.co/v0/sql
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Content-Type: text/plain

SELECT ... FORMAT JSON
```

The JWT's `filter` field enforces tenant isolation automatically on every query.
You do NOT need to add `WHERE TenantId = '...'` — Tinybird appends it server-side
based on the JWT's filter scope. Since `TenantId` is first in every table's sorting key,
ClickHouse skips all other tenants' data at the granule level.

To filter by service (project) within a tenant, add `WHERE ServiceName = '...'` to any query.

## Logs

### Recent logs

```sql
SELECT
    Timestamp,
    SeverityText,
    ServiceName,
    Body,
    TraceId,
    SpanId,
    LogAttributes,
    ResourceAttributes
FROM otel_logs
WHERE Timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100
FORMAT JSON
```

### Recent logs filtered by severity and service

```sql
SELECT
    Timestamp,
    SeverityText,
    ServiceName,

    argMax(Value, TimeUnix) AS latest_value,
    max(TimeUnix) AS last_seen
FROM otel_metrics_gauge
WHERE TimeUnix >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY ServiceName, MetricName, MetricUnit, Attributes

## Cross-signal correlation

### Find logs for a specific trace

```sql
SELECT
    Timestamp,
    SeverityText,
    ServiceName,
    Body,
    LogAttributes
FROM otel_logs
WHERE TraceId = '<trace_id>'
ORDER BY Timestamp ASC
FORMAT JSON
```

### Find traces with errors and their associated logs

```sql
SELECT
    t.TraceId,
    t.SpanName,
    t.ServiceName,
    t.StatusMessage,
    t.Duration / 1000000 AS duration_ms,
    l.Body AS log_message,
    l.SeverityText
FROM otel_traces t
LEFT JOIN otel_logs l ON t.TraceId = l.TraceId AND t.SpanId = l.SpanId
WHERE t.StatusCode = 'ERROR'
  AND t.Timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
ORDER BY t.Timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50
FORMAT JSON
```

## Errors

The `otel_errors` table stores extracted exception data from both logs and traces.
Errors are extracted by the worker when it detects `exception.type` or `exception.message`
attributes on log records or span events named `exception`.

### List issues (errors grouped by fingerprint)

```sql
SELECT
    FingerprintHash,
    anyLast(ExceptionType) AS last_type,
    anyLast(ExceptionMessage) AS last_message,
    anyLast(Level) AS last_level,
    count() AS event_count,
    min(Timestamp) AS first_seen,
    max(Timestamp) AS last_seen,
    countIf(MechanismHandled = false) AS unhandled_count
FROM otel_errors
WHERE Timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY FingerprintHash
ORDER BY last_seen DESC
LIMIT 50
FORMAT JSON
```

### List issues filtered by service

```sql
SELECT
    FingerprintHash,
    anyLast(ExceptionType) AS last_type,
    anyLast(ExceptionMessage) AS last_message,
    count() AS event_count,
    min(Timestamp) AS first_seen,
    max(Timestamp) AS last_seen,
    countIf(MechanismHandled = false) AS unhandled_count
FROM otel_errors
WHERE ServiceName = 'api-gateway'
  AND Timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY FingerprintHash
ORDER BY event_count DESC
LIMIT 50
FORMAT JSON
```

### Recent error events for a specific issue

```sql
SELECT
    Timestamp,
    ExceptionType,
    ExceptionMessage,
    ExceptionStacktrace,
    MechanismType,
    MechanismHandled,
    Level,
    Release,
    Environment,
    TraceId,
    SpanId,
    Tags
FROM otel_errors
WHERE FingerprintHash = '<fingerprint_hash>'
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20
FORMAT JSON
```

### Unhandled errors only

```sql
SELECT
    FingerprintHash,
    anyLast(ExceptionType) AS last_type,
    anyLast(ExceptionMessage) AS last_message,
    count() AS event_count,
    max(Timestamp) AS last_seen
FROM otel_errors
WHERE MechanismHandled = false
  AND Timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY FingerprintHash
ORDER BY last_seen DESC
LIMIT 50
FORMAT JSON
```

### Error rate by release

```sql
SELECT
    Release,
    count() AS error_count,
    uniq(FingerprintHash) AS unique_issues,
    countIf(MechanismHandled = false) AS unhandled_count,
    min(Timestamp) AS first_error,
    max(Timestamp) AS last_error
FROM otel_errors
WHERE Timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
  AND Release != ''
GROUP BY Release
ORDER BY last_error DESC
FORMAT JSON
```

### Error volume over time (timeseries)

```sql
SELECT
    toStartOfMinute(Timestamp) AS minute,
    count() AS error_count,
    uniq(FingerprintHash) AS unique_issues
FROM otel_errors
WHERE Timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY minute
ORDER BY minute ASC
FORMAT JSON
```

### Find error with its trace context

```sql
SELECT
    e.Timestamp,
    e.ExceptionType,
    e.ExceptionMessage,
    e.FingerprintHash,
    t.SpanName,
    t.SpanKind,
    t.Duration / 1000000 AS span_duration_ms,
    t.ServiceName
FROM otel_errors e
LEFT JOIN otel_traces t ON e.TraceId = t.TraceId AND e.SpanId = t.SpanId
WHERE e.TraceId = '<trace_id>'
ORDER BY e.Timestamp ASC
FORMAT JSON
```
